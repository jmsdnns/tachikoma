# Tachikoma

This is a set of themes based on the adorable spidertanks in Ghost In The Shell, called [Tachikomas](https://ghostintheshell.fandom.com/wiki/Tachikoma). It is also some of the environments I use, such as my whole Neovim setup or the settings I always have for Firefox.

Themes exist for Neovim, Tmux, Bash, Konsole, and iTerm2.
